Hi 👋 I am Maya Baireddy. Welcome to my GitHub!

🔭 I’m spending my time learning many new skills (see below) and practicing competitive programming. 

🌱 I’m currently learning C++ data structures. I hope to apply these skills in hackathons and my own personal projects.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on hackathons, start-ups (including tutoring), and any projects that could use my skill set at problem solving.

🎓 Accomplishments: I'm currently in Algorithms 2 class at Storming Robotos Mrs. Mabrey.

⚡ Fun fact: I enjoy the saber fencing, skiing and drawing in my free time.
